*   **Calendar Applications:** Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar
    > *Describe how to integrate with these calendar applications to automatically import events.*
*   **Task Management Tools:** Todoist, Asana
    > *Describe how to integrate with these task management tools to track time spent on tasks.*
*   **Enterprise Systems:**
    > *Describe any integration capabilities with enterprise systems like HR or project management software.*

## Configuration Management

The following configuration parameters can be adjusted:

| Parameter        | Description                                                 | Validation Rules                               | Default Value |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `DATABASE_PATH`  | Path to the SQLite database file.                          | Must be a valid file path.                     | `data.db`     |
| `SECRET_KEY`     | Secret key for Flask session management.                    | Must be a strong, randomly generated string.   | `changeme`    |
| `TIMEZONE`       | Timezone for displaying and storing time entries.          | Must be a valid IANA timezone (e.g., `UTC`). | `UTC`         |

> *Add more parameters as needed.*

## Advanced Usage Scenarios

**Scenario: Tracking Time for Different Projects**

1.  Create a new project in the Time-Balance application.
2.  Start tracking time for the project whenever you work on it.
3.  Generate a report to see how much time you've spent on each project.

**Scenario: Setting and Achieving Work-Life Balance Goals**

1.  Define specific goals for work-life balance (e.g., "Spend at least 2 hours per week on hobbies").
2.  Track your time allocation across different activities.
3.  Use the reporting engine to monitor your progress towards your goals.

## Performance Benchmarks

> *Provide information about the performance of the application, including response times and resource usage.*
> *Include recommendations for optimizing performance, such as database indexing or caching.*

## Security Considerations

*   **Password Hashing:** Passwords are securely hashed using `bcrypt`.
*   **Input Validation:** All user inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks.
*   **HTTPS:** It is highly recommended to deploy the application over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
*   **Compliance:**
    > *Include information about relevant compliance standards, such as GDPR or HIPAA.*

## Disaster Recovery

*   **Backup:** Regularly back up the SQLite database file.
    > *Describe the backup procedure.*
*   **Restoration:** To restore the application, simply copy the backup database file to the original location.
    > *Describe the restoration procedure.*

## Deployment Strategies

*   **Local Development:** Use the `flask run` command for local development.
*   **Production Deployment:** Deploy the application using a production-ready WSGI server such as Gunicorn or uWSGI.
    > *Provide instructions for deploying to platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud.*
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Integration:**
    > *Describe how to integrate the application with a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.*

## Monitoring and Logging Practices

*   **Logging:** The application uses the standard Python `logging` module to log events and errors.
    > *Describe the logging configuration and where logs are stored.*
*   **Monitoring:**
    > *Describe how to monitor the application's health and performance using tools like Prometheus or Grafana.*
